   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up API Keys**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory.
   - Add your API keys for Jikan, OMDb, and Google Gemini.
     ```
     JIKAN_API_KEY=your_jikan_api_key
     OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```
4. Create a new branch for your feature or improvement:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```
5. Make your changes following our [coding standards](#coding-standards).
6. Test your changes:
   - Run the application locally: `python src/main.py`
   - Verify new features or bug fixes work as expected.
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced.
7. Preview your changes:
   - Interact with the application to ensure UI and functionality are correct.
